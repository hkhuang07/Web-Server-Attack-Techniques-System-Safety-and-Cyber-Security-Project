# 🛡️ WEB SERVER ATTACK TECHNIQUES: A SYSTEM SAFETY AND CYBER SECURITY PROJECT 💻

This project, developed for a **System Safety and Cyber Security** course, provides an in-depth analysis of common web server attack techniques. It serves not only as a theoretical study but also as a practical guide, featuring a live demo environment and effective countermeasures to secure web systems.

## 📖 PROJECT OVERVIEW

The report covers the following key areas:

### 1. SYSTEM SAFETY OVERVIEW 🔐
* **Introduction:** Discusses the critical role of web servers in the digital age and the severe consequences of cyber attacks 💥, from financial loss to data breaches.
* **Core Concepts:** Defines essential cybersecurity terms like **Threat** 🌪️, **Vulnerability** 🩹, and **Exploit** 💣. It also outlines the five-phase attack lifecycle, from **Reconnaissance** 🕵️ to **Covering Tracks** 💨, and categorizes hackers into groups like **Black Hat** ⚫️, **White Hat** ⚪️, and **Script Kiddie** 👶.
* **Role of System Safety:** Explains how system security is built upon the foundational principles of **Confidentiality** 🤫, **Integrity** ✅, **Availability** ⏰, and **Authenticity** 🆔.

### 2. WEB SERVER ATTACK TECHNIQUES ⚔️
* **SQL Injection:** A detailed look into one of the most dangerous web vulnerabilities. The project explains how attackers exploit flawed input validation to inject malicious SQL commands and manipulate databases 🕵️‍♀️. It covers various attack types, including **Login Bypass** 🔑, **UNION SELECT** 🔗, and **Blind SQL Injection** 🕶️. 
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Explores how attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, targeting end-users instead of the server. The report distinguishes between **Reflected XSS**, **Stored XSS**, and **DOM-based XSS**, and highlights their impacts, such as cookie theft 🍪 and phishing 🎣.
* **Other Vulnerabilities:** The project also analyzes other critical attack vectors:
    * **Directory Traversal (Path Traversal)** 📂
    * **File Upload Vulnerability** 📤
    * **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)** 💥
    * **Brute-Force and Dictionary Attacks** 🤖
    * **Misconfiguration Exploitation** (e.g., Directory Listing, Default Credentials) ⚙️

---

### 3. PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION 🧪
A live demo section illustrates the attack methods discussed. It includes:
* A description of the demo environment 🖥️.
* A list of tools used, such as **Havji**, **SQL Ninja**, **Acunetix**, and **W3AF** 🛠️.
* Step-by-step instructions on how to replicate the attacks in a controlled, ethical hacking environment 🧑‍💻.

---

### 4. COUNTERMEASURES AND DEFENSE 🛡️
This section provides practical, actionable strategies to protect web servers. Key recommendations include:
* **Input Validation & Sanitization:** The fundamental defense against injection attacks. 🧼
* **Prepared Statements:** The most effective method to prevent SQL Injection by separating SQL code from user data. ➡️
* **Securing File Uploads:** Techniques to prevent the upload and execution of malicious files. 🔒
* **Implementing Security Systems:** The use of **Firewalls** 🔥 and **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)** 🚨 to monitor and block suspicious traffic.
